               <ul class="custom-list4">
                  <li> Personal Identifiers and records information – We may collect information such as name,
                     alias, email address, postal or delivery address, account name, phone number, signature, or
                     other similar identifiers.

                  </li>
                  <li> Biometric information – We may collect face photo, identity document, facial recognition,
                     voice, or other biometric data. Any biometric information will be permanently deleted from the

                  </li>
                  <li> Commercial Information – When you place an order through our Services, we collect
                     information related to that order. This may include information such as items purchased,
                     special instructions, date and time of order, subtotal, photos that you provide to Comchopp,

                  <li> Payment Information – Payment information collected such as bank name, payment method,
                     or other financial information. We use a payment processor that collects your payment
                     information and processes payments made on or through the Services. We obtain limited
                     information about your payment card from our payment processor, such as the last four digits
                     of your card and the expiration date.

                  Riders or contact us, by online chat, email, phone or text, we may automatically collect and store
                  certain information about you and the activity you engaged in, for example: your name and contact
                  information; your order details; information that you voluntarily provide to us; the nature of your
                  communication; the purpose of the interaction, and the action we took in response to your inquiry or

               <h5 class="col-black"> 1c. Information Collected Automatically </h5>

               </p>
               <ul class="custom-list4">
                  <li> Technical Information – We collect technical information associated with your activity on our
                     Site and may include information related to your browser and operating system, IP address
                     (the Internet address of your computer), unique device identifiers, personal and online
                     identifiers, and other information such as your device type and version of the app that is in

                     accessing our Site or mobile application, the pages or features of our Site or mobile
                     application that you browsed to inform us which part of our Site, app and Services you visit
                     and how much time you spend there.
                  </li>
                  <li> Site Preferences – We collect information about your preferences to make your use of the
                     Site more productive through the use of cookies.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <h5 class="col-black"> 1d. Location Information </h5>
               <p class="col-black"> When you use the Services, we may collect and store general location information (such as IP
                  address). We may also collect route information and delivery pick-up or drop-off information. If you
                  permit the Services to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile
                  operating system (“Platform”) or browser, we may also collect and store the precise location of your
                  device when the Comchopp app is running in the foreground or background of your device. This
                  information may be used to help you select your delivery address, to provide more accurate
                  deliveries of your orders, to provide recommendations to you, and to enhance your user experience
                  and improve the services. You can choose whether to enable the location tracking feature through
                  the settings on your device or Platform or when prompted by the Comchopp mobile app. If you
                  choose to disable the location feature, the Delivery person(s) will not receive precise location
                  information from your device, which may compromise the accuracy of deliveries in some situations,
                  for instance, if you are located in a large area, such as a park.
               </p>
               <h5 class="col-black"> 1e. Information Related to the Referral Program or Gift Option </h5>
               <p class="col-black"> Comchopp allows users to send gifts using the Services and invite friends and family to sign up for
                  our Services. Sometimes we offer a promotional value for every friend or family member who signs
                  up and places an order through your referral link. To help you do this, we may request you to grant
                  us access to your mobile device address book. You can then direct us to send referral emails to
                  contacts you select in your address book. By sending a referral or gift, you consent to Comchopp
                  sending your public profile image to the contacts you select to receive a referral link or gift. By
                  choosing to invite a friend or sending a gift to a recipient, you represent that you have received the
                  friend’s and/or recipient’s consent to provide his or her name, mailing address, email address or
                  other information with us. Comchopp will use that information to send the requested gift or an email
                  inviting him or her to visit the site and will store that information to track the success of the referral
                  program and may send marketing emails. You can also send an SMS with a referral link to your
                  contacts. If you use this option, you understand that Comchopp does not control the timing, content,
                  or recipients of these SMS messages.
               </p>
               <p class="col-black"> Users may not send, publish, or share any false, misleading, or deceptive communications in
                  connection with participation in the Referral Program. Such actions may violate various applicable
                  laws. Comchopp users may not send any referral emails, SMS messages, or other communications
                  to children under the age of 13.
               </p>
               <p class="col-black"> If you are referred to Comchopp through one of our referral programs, or if someone attempts to
                  refer you, we may share your name, whether you have already signed up for Comchopp, whether
                  you are a new customer, and whether you have placed a qualifying order with Comchopp with the
                  person(s) who referred you.

               <h5 class="col-black"> 1f. Personal Information from Publicly Available Sources and Third Parties </h5>
               <p class="col-black"> We may collect Personal Information about you from publicly available sources, social network
                  providers, marketing partners, and third parties. This may include:

               <p class="col-black">  We use cookies, web beacons, pixels, session replay/screen capture, and similar technologies to
                  collect information and personalize your experience with our Services. When we use session replay
                  technology, we may collect on a real-time basis information on how you use and navigate the
                  Services. This may include mouse movements and how you scroll through the Services, but we do
                  not collect keystroke data. Additional information on other technologies we may use is set forth
                  below.
               </p>
               <h5 class="col-black"> 2a. Cookies </h5>
               <p class="col-black"> Cookies are small web files that a site or its provider transfers to your device’s hard drive through
                  your web browser that enables the site’s or provider’s system to recognize your browser and
                  remember certain information.
               </p>
               <h5 class="col-black"> <b> How We Use Cookies </b> – We use first-party and third-party cookies for the following purposes: </h5>
               <ul class="custom-list4">
                  <li> to make our Services function properly;  </li>
                  <li> to improve our Services; </li>
                  <li> to recognize you when you return to our Site and to remember information you have already

                  </li>
                  <li> to collect information about your activities over time and across third party websites or other

               <h5 class="col-black"> 2b. Web Beacons  </h5>
               <p class="col-black"> Web beacons, also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs, are tiny graphics with a unique
                  identifier that may be included on our Site to deliver or communicate with cookies, in order to track
                  and measure the performance of our Site and Services, monitor how many web visitors we have,
                  and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s
                  hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on webpages (or in an email).
               </p>
               <h5 class="col-black"> 2c. Online Analytics and Advertising Technologies </h5>
               <p class="col-black"> We and our third-party vendors may use automated technologies (including cookie identifiers on our
                  Site), along with other collected information, to tailor ads or deliver content when you are on our
                  Services or on other devices, apps or websites.
               </p>
               <h5 class="col-black"> 2d. Targeted Advertising  </h5>
               <p class="col-black"> We (or our service providers) may use the information we collect, for instance, IP addresses and
                  unique mobile device identifiers, to locate or try to locate the same unique users across multiple
                  browsers or devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or computers), or work with providers that do
                  this, in order to better tailor content and features and provide you with a seamless experience across
                  devices. If you wish to opt out of such cross device tracking for purposes of interest-based
                  advertising, you may do so through your device settings. We may also use cross-device tracking to
                  help identify our users and serve advertising. This type of advertising is often called “interest-based”

                     your Personal Information by logging into our Site using your username and password and
                     visiting the “Account” page. Registered Comchopp users may also access the “Account”

                     having your Personal Information sold. The California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) amends
                     the California Consumer Privacy Act to broadly define “sale” in a way that may include
                     allowing third parties to receive certain information such as cookie identifiers, IP addresses
                     and/or browsing behavior to add to a profile about your device, browser or you. Such profiles
                     may enable delivery of interest-based advertising by such third parties within their platform or
                     on other sites. Depending on how you use the Services, we may share the following
                     categories of information for such interest-based advertising which may be considered a sale
                     (as defined by the CPRA): (1) device information and identifiers, such as IP address and
                     unique advertising identifiers and cookies; and (2) connection and usage information, such
                     as browsing history or app usage. Although this obligation of the CPRA does not become
                     effective until January 1, 2023, you may opt out of such tracking technologies by following
                     the instructions in Section 2 above.
